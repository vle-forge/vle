VLE 2.0
=======

Release highlights
------------------

### C++11/14

All the source code and API move to the C++11/14. Compiler
requirements are now gcc 4.9 or clang 3.5 available in Ubuntu LTS
14.04 or Debian GNU/Linux Wheezy.

Many boost functions or classes are replaced with standard functions
and classes.

### Remove dependencies:

- The libarchive-dev is remove. We replace the libarchive dependency
  to build/extract tarball with the cmake sub-process command (`cmake
  -E tar [cxt][vf][zjJ] file.tar` command).

- All boost binary libraries are removed. `boost::random`,
  `boost::thread`, `boost::filesystem`, `boost::system`,
  `boost::date_time`, `boost::unittest_framework`.

### Changes in public API

- Less less and less.

- No singleton nor static variables.

- Only dependency with the standard C++ library.

### Kernel Parallelization

We add a thread pool into the kernel `src/vle/devs/Thread.hpp` to parallelize
with threads the PDEVS/DSDE immediate bag. It is the more pessimist
parallelization approach and gains are obtained with big models, big transitions
sources codes and big bags.

To active the parallelization in VLE, use the following command:

    vle -C vle.simulation.thread 8
    vle -C vle.simulation.block-size 128

These settings will use 8 threads (for an eight cores processor for example) and
the PDEVS/DSDE immediate bag will be treat in blocks of 128 simulators.

To disable the use of the parallelization mechanism, uses the following
commands:

    vle -C vle.simulation.thread 0
    vle -C vle.simulation.block-size 0

### 'System' binary packages

The Git repository of VLE provides some very useful packages for VLE
and GVLE (`vle.output`, `vle.aqss`, `gvle.simulation` etc.). These
packages installed in the `$prefix/lib/vle-2.0/pkgs` (`$prefix` is the
installation prefix of VLE. A read-only directory) simplify
installation of VLE: VLE can be use without using the Github packages
repository.

Default, priority goes to `$VLEHOME/pkgs-2.0` instead of system
packages `$prefix/lib/vle-2.0/pkgs`. So, if you want to develop
another `vle.output` package, nothing change.

### Debug

The Debug mode is available at run-time (without the use of
DECLARE\_DYNAMICS\_DBG macro). In the VPZ, we can provides a
`debug="yes"` attribute to the `model` element to debug the atomic
model. Before, we have to use the `DynamicsDbg.hpp` and replace the
inheritance from `vle::devs::Dynamics` to `vle::devs:DynamicsDbg`.

The `DynamicsDbg.hpp` header is removed from public API.

In private implementation, the debug mode use the
`vle::devs::DynamicsDbg` class placed between the
`vle::devs::Simulator` and user's dynamics model.

### Observation

The Observation mechanism use the same behaviors than debug mode. A
class between `vle::devs::Simulator` and the user's dynamics or debug
model (of course).

We adjust the VPZ to provide observation for output, internal,
external, confluent and finish functions by updating the `type`
attribute in the `View` element of the VPZ. Type can be:

- `event`: View::INTERNAL | View::EXTERNAL | View::CONFLUENT
- `output`: View::OUTPUT
- `internal`: View::INTERNAL;
- `external`: View::EXTERNAL;
- `confluent`: View::CONFLUENT;
- `finish`: View::FINISH;

Finally, an observation View can be enable or disable in GVLE and in R, python
package. This feature can be useful to add debug observation mode without cost
to simulation kernel. In previous VLE version, the output plug-in Dummy was
used.

### Model in executable

From now, ModelFactory and StreamWriter can load symbol into the main
program instead of the shared libraries specified by the package
information. To use this feature, the package must be empty in the
vpz::Dynamics or vpz::Output object. Then the library is used to
define the symbol to load. For example:

- `vpz::Dynamics { Package = "toto", Library = "titi" }` loads the
  shared library `$VLE_HOME/pkgs-1.x/toto/lib/simulator/libtiti.so`
  and try to found the `vle_make_dynamics` symbol.

- `vpz::Dynamics { Package = "", library="make_titi" }` loads the
  symbol `make_titi`.

If the library name starts with `exe_` or `wra_` then symbols
respectively define a `vle::devs::Executive` or a
`vle::devs::DynamicsWrapper`.

### Experimental frames

Two new features:
- Simulations can be start in subprocess so, if a simulation segmentation
  fault, the master process do not close.
- The `cvle`, `vle` and `mvle` accept an `--timeout [ms]` parameter to limit
  the duration of the simulation subprocess to avoid too long simulation
  process.

### Graph and regular graph generators

Provides a new `vle::translator` public API with:
- random small-worfireld, random scale-free, random erdos renyi graphs generators.
- regular 1d and 2d graph generator with wrap and mask neighborhood definition.
- user defined graph (as in VLE 1.x).


### GVLE

GVLE is completely rewritten with QT 5. The old GVLE in Gtkmm [2,3] is removed
and all plug-ins are disabled or rewritten.

### CMake

The users CMake scripts are updated to simplify the development of packages.
